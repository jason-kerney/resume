# Building Your Resume Like a Boss with CI


## Introduction

If you're a developer geek like I am, you'll want to check this out. This repository builds my resume using continuous integration. Seriously! You can find the live resume **[here](http://resume.jason.teamkerney.com)**.

What other way can you show you know the agile development lifecycle by expressing it through your resume itself. It's just a few easy steps.

Here you'll find all you need to deploy and create your own resume. We are using the nifty [resume-cli](https://www.npmjs.org/package/resume-cli) command line tool from [JSON Resume](http://jsonresume.org) to compile our resume from a JSON schema into HTML and even PDF. This guide will walk through how to use Continuous Integration to validate and git deploy your resume!

## Getting Setup
